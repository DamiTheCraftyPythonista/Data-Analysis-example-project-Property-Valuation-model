# Data-Analysis-example-project-Property-Valuation-model

This is a short, fun Jupyter Notebook from a course I took. In it, I solve miscellaneous tasks and challenges set by the instructor to explore dataset containing data about Property and then created a property valuation model using multivariable linear regression. 

The aim of this project is to showcase my proficiency in data science and basics of ML.

# Credits
